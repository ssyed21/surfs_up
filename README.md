## Overview
The purpose of this report was to give more information about temperature trends for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
## Results
Seen from the June results below, we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0


And for December, we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0

The main differences were that the temperature on average was higher in June, the min temperature was lower in December, and the max temperature was higher in June.

## Summary
As the results are based off temperature readings, it is neccessary to take into account other data such as percipitation rates. From gathering more information we can make a better judgement on the sustainability of the shop.
